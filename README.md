# ImageProcessingApplication

Using the MVC (Model, View, Controller) object-oriented design, this Image Processing Application allows for the importing, exporting, and saving of images in a variety of popular file formats, such as JPEG and PNG, and PPM. The application also allows for the manipulating of images. Images can be filtered, grayscaled, rotated, flipped, brightened/darkened, and sepia-toned. 

See README.txt and USEME.txt in the "ImageProcessingApplication" folder for more specifics.
